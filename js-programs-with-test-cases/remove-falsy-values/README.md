### Instructions

- Remove all falsy values from an array.

### filter()

- filter() does not mutate the array on which it is called. The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

### Boolean

- value is true/false. If the value is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false. All other values, including any object, an empty array ([]), or the string "false", create an object with an initial value of true.
